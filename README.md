# CHALLENGING DATA FOR SUSTAINABLE CITIES
# Scaling Micromobility to meet citizen demand in Matosinhos

EUREKATHON is a data-driven competition that addresses societal issues associated with sustainable development goals.

In this 3rd edition, the challenge was to develop a concrete and creative solution to help the city of Matosinhos in achieving the goal of being a more sustainable city .

Our strategy aimed at increasing micro-mobility in the city by 10% through the identification of areas with most potential demand. In order to reinforce our approach, we used unsupervised machine learning to classify them according to their specific characteristics.

With this, we were able to provide the city council with a tailor-made tool to expland micromobility infrastructure with a clear target.
